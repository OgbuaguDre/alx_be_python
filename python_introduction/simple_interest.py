# Define the variables
principal = 1000      # principal amount (P)
rate = 0.05           # annual interest rate in decimal (R)
time = 3              # time in years (T)

# Calculate simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
